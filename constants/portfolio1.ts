    description:
      'Globally, the urban population is increasing rapidly to 55% and is expected to increase to 68% by 2050. This rapid population increase will take place mainly in developing countries, so proper planning and management is essential for sustainable urban development.\n\nThere is a huge demand of food supply for urban inhabitants due to the increasing trend of urbanization. The current food system in the cities cannot meet the growing food demand sustainably. With urbanization, food insecurity issues arise and modern urban agriculture systems could be a means to decrease food supply risks. Urban agriculture can play a valuable role in sustainable food systems with environmental, social, economic and health benefits. So the national and local governments need to become more strategic in responding to the challenges and opportunities posed by rapid urbanization by formulating a national urbanization strategy and better coordinated actions by all the stakeholders involved including the private sector.\n\nInitiation of Food Green City Program\nFor urban areas to produce food itself and maintain greenery, the concept of Food Green City (FGC) has been established by integrating urban agriculture with urban planning for addressing socio-economic and environmental issues. This initiation is an effort of the academy for achieving its motto ‚ÄúScience for Society and Innovation for Prosperity‚Äù by implementing applicability of its research findings in the community level and providing demand based technical supports.',
